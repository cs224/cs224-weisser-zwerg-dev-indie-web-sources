## Rational

I have ignored the crypto space for the past 10 years, but thought that now it might be a good time to dig myself a bit deeper into that technology
space. I've selected the [Cardano](https://docs.cardano.org/) eco-system, because some people say that it is one of the most advanced technology
eco-systems.

### Our Art NFT: Mona Lisa 4.0 by Shuksy

The past week-end my daughter and I made it our week-end project to create our first NFT ([Non-Fungible
Token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token)) on the Cardano blockchain.

Here it is: [Mona Lisa 4.0](https://pool.pm/9a093f9c42ebe91b440af75e5554818e2805b5c6358ae5efe2478cf0.MonaLisa40)<br>
