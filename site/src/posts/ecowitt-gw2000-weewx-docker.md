## Rational

After my failed attempt to set-up a secondary weather station receiver in [Ecowitt WS2910 868MHz weather station and Software Defined Radio
(SDR)](../ecowitt-ws2910-868mhz-sdr) I decided to go the "standard" route and buy an Ecowitt [GW2000](https://shop.ecowitt.com/products/gw2000)[^ecowittmhz]
(Wittboy) gateway and use it to feed a dockerized [WeeWX](https://weewx.com/) weather station software instance.

This sounds simple enough, but dockerized `WeeWX` does not seem to be the norm and therefore poses some challenges.

## Setting up the Ecowitt GW2000 (Wittboy) Gateway

This was a really simple process. The only slightly negative experience was that the gateway package did include a usb power cable, but not a usb
power supply. Most likely due to the fact that all around the world the power plugs are different. But be aware that you will have to buy one in addition.

You can find the whole set-up process instructions in the gateway [manual](https://osswww.ecowitt.net/uploads/20211215/GW2000%20Manual.pdf) and
further supporting material plus the download links to the smart phone apps [here](https://www.ecowitt.com/support/download/178) and
[here](https://www.ecowitt.com/api/quickstart/product?id=245).

After powering-up the `GW2000` gateway, it opens up a Wireless Access Point. Once you connect to it you will have to browse to `http://192.168.4.1` to open
the embedded web page. From there the next steps to connect to your standard WLAN network are self-explanatory.

Once the gateway is in your standard WLAN you should use the router to find out the gateway's IP address and open it in your browser like
`http://192.168.178.97`. Via my FRITZ!Box I can use the URL `http://gw200x-wh268x.fritz.box/`. In the `Sensors ID` section of the web-interface it
detected my weather station as a `Temp & Humidity & Solar & Wind & Rain` device automatically.

In the `Weather Services` section of the web-interface you find the device's `MAC` address that you can use to integrate the device into
[ecowitt.net](https://www.ecowitt.net).

In the same `Weather Services` section further down you will also find the section `Customized` that you will need to configure to feed data into the
`WeeWX` instance. The `IP` address I used for the `WeeWX` host is `192.168.178.5` and the port `2324` I configured in the `weewx.conf`. We will look at
that later, but here is how the configuration of the gateway looks like:

## Dockerized WeeWX

By now I expect a seamless experience and a well-documented process to set-up software packages like `WeeWX` via docker. But here is where the
problems start: the [documentation](http://weewx.com/docs.html) of `WeeWX` does not mention a dockerized install process at all.

> <span style="font-size:smaller"> This statement is not completely correct. If you search more extensively you come across the
> [docker](https://github.com/weewx/weewx/wiki/docker) page in the `WeeWX` [wiki](https://github.com/weewx/weewx/wiki), which mentions two
> repositories that are both outdated: [jgoerzen/docker-weewx](https://salsa.debian.org/jgoerzen/docker-weewx) and
> [MrNonoss/WeewX-Docker](https://github.com/MrNonoss/WeewX-Docker).

This is when you
start searching if somebody else has done the job for you. While I found several other starting points the only repo on GitHub, I found that has a
[Dockerfile](https://github.com/felddy/weewx-docker/blob/develop/Dockerfile) upgraded to the most recent version `4.10.2` (at the moment) was the
[weewx-docker](https://github.com/felddy/weewx-docker) repo from [felddy](https://github.com/felddy). But this repository does not seem to be
maintained in other ways like [No module named 'Cheetah', ](https://github.com/felddy/weewx-docker/issues/18) and other issues. Anyway, I decided to
stick with it.

This container has the following WeeWX extensions pre-installed:
* https://github.com/matthewwall/weewx-mqtt
* https://github.com/matthewwall/weewx-interceptor

### Patch the Dockerfile

The first step is to clone the [weewx-docker](https://github.com/felddy/weewx-docker) repository and then copy and paste the content of the following
`diff` into a `Dockerfile.patch` file right beside the `Dockerfile` in the repository:

```diff
*** orig/Dockerfile     2023-04-03 06:14:34.098472924 +0200
--- modified/Dockerfile 2023-04-03 06:20:27.384291437 +0200
***************
*** 47,52 ****
--- 47,58 ----
  ENV PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"
  RUN pip install --no-cache --requirement requirements.txt
  
+ RUN pip install --no-cache wheel setuptools
+ RUN pip install --no-cache configobj paho-mqtt pyserial pyusb
+ RUN pip install --no-cache Cheetah3
+ RUN pip install --no-cache Pillow==9.4.0
+ RUN pip install --no-cache ephem
+ 
  WORKDIR /root
  
  RUN bin/wee_extension --install /tmp/weewx-mqtt.zip
```

Then you can apply the changes via the [patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(Unix)) tool:

    > patch -p1 Dockerfile < Dockerfile.patch

Or you just make the changes by hand.

> <span style="font-size:smaller"> Just as a side remark: in this `Dockerfile` I saw for the first time the `BUILDPLATFORM` variable and I was curious. You can find more details here:
>
> * <span style="font-size:smaller">  https://www.docker.com/blog/faster-multi-platform-builds-dockerfile-cross-compilation-guide : `BUILDPLATFORM` is part of a set of automatically defined (global scope) build arguments that you can use.

>
> <span style="font-size:smaller"> In addition, I wanted to know what this `xx` Docker image does: https://github.com/tonistiigi/xx : xx provides tools to support cross-compilation from Dockerfiles that understand the `--platform` flag ...

Once that is done you build the image on the machine where you want to use it:

    > docker build . --tag weewx:4.10.2

### docker-compose

You would think that once you have the docker image you're done and can start using it by just providing a few command line arguments to the docker
run command. I was surprised to see that the [weewx-docker](https://github.com/felddy/weewx-docker) documentation did not mention any port mappings
for its docker compose file. There has to be some way that my Ecowitt `GW2000` can send its data packets to this instance and there has to be some way
via which a web-browser can access the web application, or so I thought. I was expecting at least one port mapping for an integrated webserver that
would receive the gateway data packets at one URL and serve the web application at the root URL.

But this is not how `WeeWX` works. While `WeeWX` is a long running process it works by regularly (as far as I can tell every 5 minutes) generating
static HTML pages, but `WeeWX` does not come with an integrated webserver or similar. This means you need to add something like `nginx` to the
picture. And while the [weewx-docker](https://github.com/felddy/weewx-docker) image has
[weewx-interceptor](https://github.com/matthewwall/weewx-interceptor) (This is a driver for weewx that receives and parses network traffic) integrated
the documentation does not talk about how to set it up to receive the data-packets from the gateway.

As I had to create a more involved `docker-compose.yml` file anyway I added [Duplicati](https://www.duplicati.com/) to the mix to be able to configure
regular backups:

```yml
services:
  duplicati:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/duplicati
    environment:
      - PUID=0 # 1000
      - PGID=0 # 1000
      - TZ=Europe/Berlin
      - CLI_ARGS= #optional
    volumes:
      - /opt/weewx/data/duplicati/config:/config
      - /opt/weewx/data:/source
      - /opt/weewx/duplicati-backup:/target
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:2325:8200/tcp"
  web:
    image: nginx:1.23.0
    networks:
      - wxnet
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:2305:80/tcp"
    depends_on:
      - weewx
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/Berlin
      #- NGINX_HOST=<<YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME>>.com
      #- NGINX_PORT=80
    volumes:
      - /opt/weewx/data/weewx/public_html:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro
      # - /media/docker/volumes/ngnix/templates:/etc/nginx/templates
    restart: unless-stopped
  weewx:
    image: weewx:4.10.2
    networks:
      - wxnet
    ports:
      - "0.0.0.0:2324:2324/tcp"
    init: true
    restart: unless-stopped
    # devices:
    #   - "/dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0"
    # privileged: true
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: /opt/weewx/data/weewx/data
        target: /data
      - type: bind
        source: /opt/weewx/data/weewx/public_html
        target: /home/weewx/public_html
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/Berlin
      - TIMEZONE=Europe/Berlin
      - WEEWX_UID=weewx
      - WEEWX_GID=dialout

networks:
  wxnet:
    driver: bridge
```

All ports are only open on `localhost` except the port 2324, where [weewx-interceptor](https://github.com/matthewwall/weewx-interceptor) receives its
data packets from the gateway.

You will also need to create the directory structure under `/opt/weewx`:

```txt
root@pi:/opt/weewx# tree
.
├── data
│   ├── duplicati
│   └── weewx
│       ├── data
│       │   ├── weewx.conf
│       │   └── weewx.sdb
│       └── public_html
├── docker-compose.yaml
└── duplicati-backup
```

    > mkdir -p /opt/weewx/data/duplicati
    > mkdir -p /opt/weewx/data/weewx/data
    > mkdir -p /opt/weewx/data/weewx/public_html
    > mkdir -p /opt/weewx/duplicati-backup

And put the above `docker-compose.yaml` at `/opt/weewx/docker-compose.yaml`.

You will also need to adapt access rights for the places where the `weewx` container will write data to. It acts as the user `WEEWX_UID=421` (see the
Dockerfile) under the group `dialout`.

    > chown root:dialout /opt/weewx/data/weewx/data
    > chown root:dialout /opt/weewx/data/weewx/public_html
    > chmod g+w /opt/weewx/data/weewx/data
    > chmod g+w /opt/weewx/data/weewx/public_html

### Configure WeeWX

The next step is to configure `WeeWX`. This means to create the `weewx.conf` and the `weewx.sdb` files at `/opt/weewx/data/weewx/data` that you see in
the above `tree` command output already but won't be there unless you create them. First start and create dummy files by executing the following:

    > cd /opt/weewx
    > docker compose run weewx

For all questions just hit enter. This will create 3 files: the above-mentioned `weewx.conf` and the `weewx.sdb` and a file like
`weewx.conf.20230401170108`. This last file seems to be the default file and can be used to patch it. I suggest that you adapt the below patch file
manually to your settings and then copy it to `/opt/weewx/data/weewx/data/weewx.conf.patch`:

```diff

Once you have that just do the following:

    > cd /opt/weewx/data/weewx/data
    > cp weewx.conf.20230401170108 weewx.conf
    > patch -p1 weewx.conf < weewx.conf.patch

#### Mosquitto MQTT

Be aware that I have a separate [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) `MQTT` server running on `192.168.178.5`, which I did not describe how to set it
up in this blog post. The only use of that is so that you can make use of the weather data in other places like other scripts or applications. If you
don't need that functionality, then just ignore all the `MQTT` stuff or alternatively just follow any other documentation for how to set-up `Mosquitto`
like [ODROID-M1: Dockerized Home Assistant](../odroid-m1-dockerized-homeassistant/) or directly see
[here](https://github.com/cs224/odroid-m1-dockerized-homeassistant/blob/main/roles/homeassistant/templates/docker-compose.yml).

### Run WeeWX

Now you have everything in place to be able to run `WeeWX`:

    > cd /opt/weewx
    > docker compose up -d

Initially you might want to start without the `-d` option, so that you have the logs directly on the console. Alternatively, you can use `docker
compose logs` to look at the logs. You will have to wait something like 5 minutes to receive data packets from the gateway and wait until `WeeWX` runs
its report generation cycle at least once before you can see anything via the web browser. As we configured `nginx` to only serve its files locally
you either have to be on the machine where we installed `WeeWX` to browser `http://localhost:2305/index.html` or you use `ssh` something like that:

    > ssh -D 1234 -L 2325:localhost:2325 -L 2324:localhost:2324 -L 2305:localhost:2305 -L 1883:localhost:1883 your-machine-name

You should now be able to access the files generated by `WeeWX` via `http://localhost:2305/index.html` on your local machine.

#### SOCKS Proxy

The `-D` option in the `SSH` command line above might help if you want to access other machines in the remote network (like the router or similar) via
Firefox. It generates a [SOCKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS) proxy on your machine. You would have to change the proxy configuration of your
Firefox browser to something like below:

<img src="/img/ssh-socks-firefox.png" alt="SSH Socks Proxy in Firefox" style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%"><br>

Once you have done that you can browse to other places in your remote network like your router `http://192.168.178.1` or similar.

## Remaining issues

Every 5 minutes the system will generate the reports and populate the `/opt/weewx/data/weewx/public_html` folder. I still receive the following error
messages, which prevents the images from being generated:

```txt

As soon as I know how to fix that I will post an update.

## Update 2023-04-05

The short answer to the above mentioned remaining issue is that Pillow 9.5.0 was just posted on 1 April and introduced some incompatible change. The
problem was introduced with this [Pillow pull request](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/pull/6978). Therefore, the quickfix for this problem is
to use `Pillow==9.4.0` in the `Dockerfile`. I've already updated the `Dockerfile` patch above accordingly. The future fix for `weewx` is
[here](https://github.com/weewx/weewx/issues/862).

### WeeWX: Installation using setup.py

In order to help debug the problem I had to set-up `weewx` from sources. I followed the instructions outlined here: [WeeWX: Installation using
setup.py](https://weewx.com/docs/setup.htm), but I used a [conda](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) environment with [pip](https://pypi.org/)
installs rather than using the operating system packages. The quick version of it all is the following:


    > mamba create -n weewx python=3.9
    > conda activate weewx
    > pip3 install configobj paho-mqtt pyserial pyusb Cheetah3 Pillow ephem
    > wget https://weewx.com/downloads/weewx-4.10.2.tar.gz
    > tar -xzvf weewx-4.10.2.tar.gz
    > cd weewx-4.10.2
    > python3 ./setup.py build
    > python3 ./setup.py install
    > # create the weewx.conf.patch from here: https://weisser-zwerg.dev/posts/ecowitt-gw2000-weewx-docker/
    > patch -p1 weewx.conf < weewx.conf.patch # or make the changes manually
    > wget -O weewx-mqtt.zip https://github.com/matthewwall/weewx-mqtt/archive/master.zip
    > ./bin/wee_extension --install ./weewx-mqtt.zip
    > wget -O weewx-interceptor.zip https://github.com/matthewwall/weewx-interceptor/archive/master.zip
    > ./bin/wee_extension --install ./weewx-interceptor.zip
    > wget -O weewx-gw1000.tar.gz https://github.com/gjr80/weewx-gw1000/releases/download/v0.5.0b5/gw1000-0.5.0b5.tar.gz
    > ./bin/wee_extension --install ./weewx-gw1000.tar.gz
    > # optional: PYTHONPATH=/home/wyse/opt/weewx/bin python -m user.gw1000 --test-driver
    > # -------------------
    > ./bin/weewxd

#### weewx-gw1000 driver

Along the process I found the [weewx-gw1000](https://github.com/gjr80/weewx-gw1000) driver. I was not aware that the `Ecowitt` WLAN gateways (not only
the `GW1000` or `GW2000`, but also the `WH2910` or `WS2910` console) offer their data via port 45000 (see [Data Exchange TCP Protocol for
GW1000,1100,1900,2000,2680,2650](https://osswww.ecowitt.net/uploads/20220407/WN1900%20GW1000,1100%20WH2680,2650%20telenet%20v1.6.4.pdf)). Here is a
web version: [Telnet Protocol](https://ambientweather.com/faqs/question/view/id/1537/)[^packetsender].

This means that you could avoid opening up port 2324 to the outside world, which might be a gain from the security side.

You can find out how to configure the `weewx-gw1000` driver on its web-site, but the quick version of it is to add something like the following above
the `[Interceptor]` section of the `weewx.conf` file:

```ini
##############################################################################

[GW1000]
    # This section is for the Ecowitt Gateway driver.

    # How often to poll the API, default is every 20 seconds:
    poll_interval = 20

    # The driver to use:
    driver = user.gw1000
    ip_address = 192.168.178.97
    port = 45000
```

### WeeWX Weather Data Center skin (weewx-wdc)

The [WeeWX Weather Data Center skin](https://github.com/Daveiano/weewx-wdc) might be the next thing you might want to look at. You can see a running
example here: [https://www.weewx-hbt.de](https://www.weewx-hbt.de). You can also look at a walk-through (in German) here: [WLAN Wetterstation von
ecowitt](https://youtu.be/jgyqSV-op9M?t=532). The steps to set this up are not difficult. Just look at the sample
[Dockerfile](https://github.com/Daveiano/weewx-wdc-interceptor-docker/blob/main/Dockerfile) provided by the creator of `weewx-wdc`.

## Footnotes

[^ecowittmhz]: Pay attention to buy the right gateway for your weather station by selecting the correct `MHz` value in the Ecowitt shop!
[^packetsender]: You might want to use [packetsender](https://packetsender.com) to play with the protocol.
