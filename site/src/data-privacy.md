## Data Privacy

This web-site is a pure hobby endeavor and I am not profiting from it via any third party, neither financially nor in any other way. In case that I
mention companies or products on this web-site I only do so in order for you to be able to find quickly one option on how to get things done.

This site uses [Google Analytics](https://privacy.google.com/businesses/compliance) for me to understand the nature of my visitors purely on a
statistical basis and to allow me to optimize my stories for my intended target audience. Just as a side-remark: I personally use in my browsers
[uBlock Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin) to avoid being tracked by third parties.

This site is hosted on [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/) and uses Firebase only for hosting. Firebase provides some
basic statistics about the visitors of the site, but I do not store any user data besides what firebase hosting does by default on its own. I am not
sure in how far Firebase uses cookies for session tracking. This site does not need session tracking and does not make use of that functionality if it
exists.

This site uses [utterances](https://github.com/utterance/utterances/issues/37) and its
[GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-privacy-statement) back-end to provide you with the means to participate in conversations around the
stories on this site.

If you chose to sign-up to get new posts via e-mail the service will be provided via
[specificfeeds.com](https://www.specificfeeds.com/blog/update-on-gdpr/). Alternatively you can subscribe directly to the site's
[RSS-feed](/feed/feed.xml) with your preferred [feed-reader](https://www.rss-readers.org/list-of-rs-feed-reader). I personally like to use the
combination [aperture](https://aperture.p3k.io)/[alltogethernow.io](https://alltogethernow.io). Read the [Microsub](https://indieweb.org/Microsub)
documentation on [indieweb.org](https://indieweb.org/Microsub) for more details.

Besides that, this site is a static site generated via the [eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) static site generator and by its nature does not store any
user data.

If you chose to send me any [webmentions](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/), I use the [webmention.io](https://webmention.io/) service to handle
those for me. After fetching the mentions the eleventy machinery stores them on GitHub in the [siteâ€™s
repository](https://github.com/cs224/weisser-zwerg-dev-indie-web-sources).
